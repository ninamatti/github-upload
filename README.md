# skill-tracker

## About this project ##
Skill tracker page built with Vanilla JavaScript and CSS with the goal in mind to make it easy and rewarding for the user to define a set of new skills they want to learn, easily track their progress and be motivated by a reward system.

## Features ##
:butterfly:For now, my skill tracker has:

1. A basic shop structure that appears when you click the shop button;
2. A basic inventory structure that appears when you click the inventory button;
3. A windowsill element that contains 5 boxes with flower pots & flowers at different stages (here, the user will be able to plant flowers). For now, I only drew three basic flowers with 3 different stages and have installed one of them at random growth stages in the pots.
4. A List with skill sets and according skills (for now, the default is set up as code chrysalis precourse and bootcamp skills for the most part) as well as a possibility to add new skill sets or a new skill to an existing skill set using the input new skill area.
5. A progress bar within the skill list (green) that will fill up when more skill boxes are checked and will empty when skills are unchecked again - linked to how many percent of all total skills are learned.
6. A 'skill tree', which will be populated with fruit blossoms or fruit, one blossom for each new skill so that it's easily visible how many skills have already been learned. The tree picture is a stand-in, I will draw my own at one point. The fruit blossom system isn't created yet.

:sunny:Features I want to add:

- Create shop content & make the inventory work, so that seeds from the inventory can be dragged over to flower pots and planted.
- A short list of daily tasks next to the windowsill. The tasks will be freely defined by the user (for example, do stretching/drink at least 2 liters of water/do one coding algorithm challenge/work on project for 15 minutes/5 min of Japanese vocabulary revision; basically, at least 3 tasks that can be turned into healthy daily habits), and the user can check them off once they are done. The mechanism will be that if the user has checked off all daily tasks for the day, the currently planted flowers will advance to the next stage the next day. If the daily tasks are not fulfilled, the flowers will stay in their current stage.
- A Login & save system, so that the current state of the page can be saved for one individual user.
- A space where a different random motivational phrase is displayed every day.
- A simple friend & message system, so that the users can connect themselves with other registered users and send them presents like seeds or in-app currency to motivate them. If too complicated, I might try to create a way presents can be sent to an e-mail address.
- A background for the skill tree that changes depending on the time of day (night/dawn/day/dusk) and some relaxing background ambient sounds.
- A system of custom backgrounds and color schemes that will eventually be accessible on the shop and can be bought with in-app currency.
Very far away, but eventually I would like to include an actual small garden instead of the windowsill, which the user can plant items in like a small farming simulator game (for example stardew valley). At that point, I want to also add new items like vegetables to the plant system.
